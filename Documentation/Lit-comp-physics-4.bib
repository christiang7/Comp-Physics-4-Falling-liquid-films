	abstract = {Falling liquid ﬁlms are examples of open ﬂows which undergo a sequence of supercritical instabilities giving way to a spatio-temporal weak disorder organized around interfacial waves in interaction. The long-wave nature of the waves and the laminar state of the ﬂow enable to derive reduced sets of equations or models that are amenable to thorough analytic investigations. This paper reviews the phenomenology of falling ﬁlm ﬂows and discusses recent low-dimensional modeling attempts. Some open questions and perspectives are also considered.},

For large c2 it is shown that the solution is unique and has a conical form. For small c2 there is a periodic solution and an infinite set of quasi-periodic solutions as asserted by Moser's twist map theorem. Numerical computations for intermediate values of c2 suggest that below c ≈ 1.6 of every speed there is a continuum of odd quasi-periodic solutions or a Cantor set of chaotic solutions wrapped by infinite sequences of conic solutions.},

	abstract = {Interfacial wave behavior and flow characteristics of falling liquid films on a vertical wall and an inclined wall have been studied by means of a numerical simulation, in which the algorithm is based on {MAC} method. Basic equations are discretized on a staggered grid fixed on a physical space. Interfacial boundary conditions are treated with a newly proposed method and the wave behavior can be calculated accurately. Simulation results agree well with experimental observations. For both the simulation and the experiment of the vertical wall, a low-frequency disturbance develops to a solitary wave, which is a big-amplitude wave accompanied by small-amplitude short capillary waves. In the big wave, a circulation flow generates and grows downstream, in which the scale of the circulation flow is comparable to the wave amplitude, while there is no circulation in the capillary waves. Although waves on the slightly inclined wall develop to the solitary wave, no circulation flow appears in the big wave because of the gravitational effect. Increasing the frequency, the wave amplitude becomes small and accompanied capillary waves disappear. In a certain frequency, the circulation flow repeats generation and collapse due to the wave interaction.},

The variables hp and uw are well described by the relations Nuw = 1.13KF0.02Nλ0.31Re0.37 and Nhp = 0.49KF0.044Nλ0.34Re0.46, and also by Nhp = 0.425KF0.019Nuw54 and Nuw = 1.13KF0.026NV12 where Nuw,Nhp.Nλ.{KF}.{NV} and Re are respectively dimension-less phase velocity, wave peak height, wave separation, physical properties group, volume of liquid carried on a wave and Reynolds number. These correlations show that the two variables λ and Γ can be replaced by one variable, V or uw, and they therefore indicate that the waves are isolated from each other. Comparisons between these correlations and data obtained from the extensive literature on the subject are discussed in relation to the surface elasticity. Shadowgrams of waves are also presented.},

If the combustible mixture is deficient in the light component, spontaneous instability will lead to self-turbulization of the flame, and the flame front assumes a strongly nonstationary cellular structure. If there is an excess of the light component, spontaneous instability produces stationary, irregular wrinkles on the flame front, and the flame continues to propagate in a laminar regime. It is shown that in all cases spontaneous instability of the flame implies an increase in its propagation velocity.},
